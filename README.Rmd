The goal of __fgeo.base__ is to provide functions with no external dependency. This makes it easy to import its functions into any __fgeo__ package without carrying any dependency, which helps keep each __fgeo__ package as small and independent as possible.

## Installation

[Install all __fgeo__ packages in one step](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/index.html#installation)

```
