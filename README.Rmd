The goal of __fgeo.base__ is to provide functions with no external dependency that can easily be imported into any other __fgeo__ package. 

__fgeo.base__ is mostly a repository of internal functions for other __fgeo.packages__: it hosts the kind of functions you would generally place in utils.R -- except it can be accessed from any other __fgeo__ package. As such, __fgeo.base__ is not directly exposed to users, although a few functions are reexported by other __fgeo__ packages. 

## Installation

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo.base")
```

For details on how to install packages from GitHub, see [this article](https://goo.gl/dQKEeg).

## Example

```{r example}
library(fgeo.base)

dfm <- data.frame(a = 1, b = NA)
drop_if_na(dfm, "b")

drop_if_na(dfm, "a")
```
