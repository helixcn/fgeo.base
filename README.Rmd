[![Coverage status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/forestgeo/fgeo.base/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/forestgeo/fgeo.base?branch=master)

The goal of __fgeo.base__ is to provide functions with no external depencency. This makes it easy to import into any __fgeo__ package withouth carrying any dependency, which helps keep each __fgeo__ package as small and independent as possible.

## Installation

```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo.base")
```

## EDIT: READ AND DELETE THIS SECTION

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
